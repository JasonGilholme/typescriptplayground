# React App with Type Script

This is the standard output from `create-react-app` with a few
additions to support .ts/.tsx files.

It's very much the same as running `create-react-app` with the `--typescript` option
however, this is to see what's required to get typescript
added to an existing react app.

## Getting started
* `cd` into this dir
* `npm install`
* `npm start` to run the web server
* `npm run typecheck` to run the static type cherk
